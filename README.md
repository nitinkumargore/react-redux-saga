# react-redux-saga

Repository created for POC of React-Redux-Thunk and React-Redux-Saga integration -
This repo has 3 folders, which can be independent repos but I have grouped them together for the demo purpose and to limit the actual number of repos to avoid the confusion later.

1. react-redux-saga => For actual integration of React Redux and Saga
2. react-redux-thunk => For actual integration of React Redux and Thunk
3. server => This is nestJS server to rune some APIs locally. We need these APIs from this server to integrate APIs in react-redux-saga POC.
